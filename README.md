# What is a neural network

A neural network is a mathematical function mapping a list of inputs to a list of outputs.

A 3-level neural network is a mathematical function of the form:

f(W2, f(W1, f(W0, I)))

Where the function f(W, I) is defined as:

f(W,I,n)[j] = sum from 1 to n over W[i] * I[i]


There is nothing magical about a neural network. It's math. Just like everything 
in programming.
